## 1 - Basic Array Manipulation:
Problem Statement: Given an array of integers, rotate it by 'k' steps to the right.
Example: For [1,2,3,4,5] with k=2, the result would be [4,5,1,2,3].

## 2 - Anagram

### Introduction and Goal:
An anagram is a word or phrase that is created by rearranging the letters of another word or phrase, using all the original letters exactly once. The goal of this problem is to determine if two given strings are anagrams of each other. For instance, the words "listen" and "silent" are anagrams.

## 3 - Stack with Two Queue

The goal is to implement a queue using two stacks. A queue follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle, whereas a stack follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle. By cleverly using two stacks, we can emulate the behavior of a queue.
