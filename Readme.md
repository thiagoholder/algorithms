## 2 - Anagram

### Introduction and Goal:
An anagram is a word or phrase that is created by rearranging the letters of another word or phrase, using all the original letters exactly once. The goal of this problem is to determine if two given strings are anagrams of each other. For instance, the words "listen" and "silent" are anagrams.
