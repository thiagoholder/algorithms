## 1 - Basic Array Manipulation:

Consider an array: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`

**Goal**: Rotate it 2 steps to the right to get `[4,5,1,2,3]`.

**Method**:
1. **Reverse the entire array**: 
    - Start with `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
    - Reverse to get `[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`
    
2. **Reverse the first `k` elements**:
    - `k` is 2, so reverse the first two elements.
    - Start with `[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`
    - Reverse first two to get `[4, 5, 3, 2, 1]`
    
3. **Reverse the remaining `n-k` elements**:
    - Remaining elements are `[3, 2, 1]` (from index 2 to end)
    - Reverse to get `[1, 2, 3]`
    - Now the array looks like: `[4, 5, 1, 2, 3]`, which is the desired result.

**Explanation**:

When you reverse the whole array, the last element (which will be the first after rotation) goes to the first position. The process of then reversing the subsets of the array (first `k` and then the remaining) is to correctly position the elements that should come after the last element in the rotated array.

**Why does this method work?**
By reversing the entire array, you basically move each element to its final rotated position but in a reversed order. The subsequent reversals are there to correct this order.

This approach takes advantage of the properties of the reversal operation, making the rotation an `O(n)` operation, which is quite efficient. It uses constant space since the reversal is done in-place, and it doesn't involve any auxiliary data structures. 

I hope that provides a clear understanding of the approach. Would you like to delve deeper into any other aspect or proceed with another topic?
