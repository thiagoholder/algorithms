Certainly! Let's dive deep into the Binary Search Tree (BST) data structure and the provided code.

### Binary Search Tree (BST)

A Binary Search Tree is a binary tree data structure where each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child. For each node, all elements in the left subtree are less than the node, and all elements in the right subtree are greater than the node.

#### Diagram:

```
       5
     /   \
    3     7
   / \   / \
  1   4 6   8
```

In the above diagram:
- Node `5` is the root.
- `3` and `7` are children of `5`.
- `1` and `4` are children of `3`.
- `6` and `8` are children of `7`.

### Code Explanation:

1. **TreeNode Class**:
This class represents a single node in the BST. Each node has a value (`Value`), a left child (`Left`), and a right child (`Right`).

2. **BinarySearchTree Class**:
This class represents the BST itself and contains methods for insertion, search, deletion, and in-order traversal.

- **Insert**: This method inserts a new value into the BST. The recursive helper method `InsertRec` is used to find the correct position for the new value.

- **Search**: This method checks if a value exists in the BST. The recursive helper method `SearchRec` traverses the tree to find the value.

- **Delete**: This method removes a value from the BST. The recursive helper method `DeleteRec` is used to find the node to delete and restructure the tree if necessary. If the node to be deleted has two children, the `MinValue` method is used to find the smallest value in the right subtree (which will replace the deleted node).

- **InOrderTraversal**: This method returns a list of values in the BST in in-order (left, root, right). The recursive helper method `InOrderRec` is used to traverse the tree in this order.
