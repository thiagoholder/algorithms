## Anagram

### Method: Frequency Count

#### Explanation:
The fundamental idea behind this method is that anagrams, by definition, have the same number and types of letters. Thus, if we can count the frequency of each letter in both strings and find them to be identical, we can confidently say that the two strings are anagrams.

#### Steps:

1. **Normalization**:
   - **Case Insensitivity**: To ensure a consistent comparison, convert all characters in the strings to a common case (either lowercase or uppercase).
   - **White Space and Special Character Handling**: Spaces, punctuation, or any other kind of whitespace might not contribute to a word's meaning in the context of anagrams. They should be removed unless the problem specification states otherwise.

2. **Preliminary Checks**:
   - **Length Check**: Anagrams must have the same number of characters. If the lengths of the two strings are different, they can't be anagrams, and we can exit early.

3. **Character Frequency Comparison**:
   - Create a frequency map for each string, where each character maps to its frequency of occurrence.
   - Compare the frequency maps of the two strings. If they are the same, the strings are anagrams.

#### Why Does This Method Work?
Counting character frequency is like taking an inventory of the two strings. If the inventories match, it means the contents of the strings (i.e., their characters) match, and thus they are anagrams. The normalization step ensures that superficial differences (like case or spaces) do not falsely indicate that two strings are not anagrams. The preliminary check is an optimization to avoid unnecessary computations for strings of different lengths.
